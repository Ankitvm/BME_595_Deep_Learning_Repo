## Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for the homeworks and project of the course BME 595 - Deep Learning. The codes have been implemented in Pytohn using th Pytorch Library for coding the Deep Networks. The instructions and details of each Homework can be found in the respective directories for the same. The list of Homeworks is enumerated as follows:

* *Homework 1*:    API for Convolution Operation 
* *Homework 2*:    API for Forward Propagation Pass / Logic Gate Implementation using ANNs 
* *Homework 3*:    API for NN Module with Back-Propagation 
* *Homework 4*:    Neural Net for MNIST Dataset using API and pytorch.nn module 
* *Homework 5*:    CNN and Fully Connected NN for CIFAR-100 dataset
